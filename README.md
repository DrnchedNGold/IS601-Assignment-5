# ðŸ§® Python Calculator & Web API Assignment

## Overview

This project is a modular Python calculator with a command-line REPL, arithmetic operations, and robust unit tests. It demonstrates best practices in Python packaging, testing, and automation.

**Features:**
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (with error handling)
- Interactive REPL (command-line calculator)
- Calculation history and help commands
- Modular code structure
- Extensive unit tests

## Project Structure & Method Details

### app/operation/

**Operation class:**  
Implements core arithmetic functions as static methods:
- `addition(a, b)`: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.
- `subtraction(a, b)`: Returns the difference of `a` and `b`.
- `multiplication(a, b)`: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.
- `division(a, b)`: Returns the quotient of `a` divided by `b`. Raises an error if `b` is zero.

These methods are used by calculation classes to perform actual math.

### app/calculation/

**Calculation (base class):**  
Defines the interface for all calculation types.  
- Stores operands `a` and `b`.
- Has an abstract `execute()` method to perform the calculation.

**AddCalculation, SubtractCalculation, MultiplyCalculation, DivideCalculation:**  
Each subclass implements `execute()` using the corresponding method from `Operation`.

**CalculationFactory:**  
- Registers calculation types and maps operation names to classes.
- `create_calculation(type, a, b)`: Returns an instance of the correct calculation class for the requested operation.

### app/calculator/

**REPL Logic:**  
- Reads user input in a loop.
- Parses commands and arguments.
- Uses `CalculationFactory` to create calculation objects.
- Calls `execute()` on calculation objects and displays results.
- Maintains a history list of calculation results.
- Handles special commands: `help`, `history`, `exit`.
- Provides error messages for invalid input, unsupported operations, and division by zero.

---

### main.py

- Entry point for the program.
- Starts the calculator REPL.

---

### tests/

- Contains unit tests for all modules.
- Tests cover correct results, error handling, and input validation.
